# Predicting the Mnetal State of the user by the Facebook Dataset
Companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon collects data to target potential customers for promoting ads.

This project helps people to understand, control and use their own personal data to learn what their data tells about thei mental state.

#### Feature 1 - Predicting the mental state of the user with Text Blob library

People post on Facebook to share their thoughts. Their posts might convey various opinion, suggestions, reviews, experience etc., it is very important to know what the users mentality was like when they posted. The Text Blob library is an in-built library in Python which is helpful in sentiment analysis. By analysing each and every posts made by the user, we can visualize their positive, negative and neutral thoughts posted by them.

#### Feature 2 - Top Friends Messaged

- People love texting isn't it? How cool will it be to see whom you have texted the most in a given time frame(Last 6 months, 12 months, etc.)?
- Which group have you been most active in?

I have visualized the number of messages that was shared only by the the user to others which will help in creating a graph within the given time frame.

Future works:
- The feature 1 can be extended to analyse the comments, groups, messages in the future.
- The feature 2 can be extended to analyse more into predicting the mental state of the user.
